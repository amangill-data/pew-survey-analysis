# PEW Survey Analysis – Solo Data Project

This project analyzes 4,455 responses from the PEW September 2020 national survey to explore how age and income influence American opinions on international relations — particularly views toward Germany vs. China.

---

## Project Objectives
- Clean and classify variables by type and scale
- Handle missing values using median/mode imputation
- Create visualizations to identify demographic trends
- Communicate insights in clear, presentation-ready format

---

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (data prep and visualizations)
- Planned upgrade to Jupyter Notebook with Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

---

## Key Findings
- **Younger Americans (18–29)** were more likely to support closer ties with **China** than older groups.
- **Middle and high-income individuals** tended to favor stronger relations with **Germany**.
- The inclusion of "Refused" and "Don't Know" responses offered additional nuance across income levels.

## Next Steps
A Jupyter Notebook version of this project is in progress to showcase Python based data analysis skills.
